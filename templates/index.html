<section class="home-intro">
  <p>Hi, I'm Ollie, a <a href="https://clojure.org/">Clojure</a> programmer living and working in London for <a href="https://www.signal-ai.com/">Signal</a>. I've worked with sprawling collection of technologies over my decade (or so) of programming, ranging from React to Ring. I'm mostly passionate about developer tooling, text editors and languages.</p>

  <p>My free time is mainly occupied by my <a href="https://neovim.io/">Neovim</a> Clojure prepl tooling, <a href="https://github.com/Olical/conjure">Conjure</a>. You'll find posts in this blog covering topics such as D3 and React integration as well as building Neovim RPC clients in Rust, it's quite eclectic.</p>

  <p>I hope you find something useful here. Have a great day!</p>
